Hello and welcome to my git. All contents here are copyright Samuel Eckstrom 2020 unless specifically code commented otherwise. Please do not reproduce or use my ideas in any shape or form.

Currently included in my git are coding samples. All were made in my free time when I was learning full stack development. I was the only one to contribute to this code, and I never intended for it to become anything, so please do not cringe at no code commenting (:
